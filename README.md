# scouting_datamodel_2022
## Description
Data model for the 2022 scouting database

## Git basics
Team 195 Git repos are hosted in the frcteam195 account of GitHUB.
Once you clone a repo you have a local copy of that repo. 
As you make changes you will need to add those changes, 
committ them, and then finally push the changes to the frcteam195 GitHUB repo to
be incorporated into the repo for others to pull from

## Git commands
To clone this repo use the command `git clone git@github.com:frcteam195/scouting_datamodel_2022.git`

To check the status of the local repository use the command `git status`

to restore a locally changed file to the version on the Team195 GitHUB repo
use the commandd `git restore 'filename'` e.g. "git restore README.md"

New files and files that have been changed on the local repo must be added
prior to committing and pushing the file to the GitHUB repo. Use the command
`git add 'filename'` to add a single file e.g "git add README.md". Use the
command `git add *` to add all new and changed files
